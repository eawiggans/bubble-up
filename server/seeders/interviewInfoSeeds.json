    "subject": "Node.js",
    "prompt": "How has Node.js changed the way we approach server-side web development?",
    "response": "Node.js has revolutionized server-side web development by introducing JavaScript as a server-side language. This has made it easier for front-end developers to transition into full-stack development, as they already know the language. Node.js also allows for faster development with its asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model. This has greatly increased the performance of web applications.",
    "resFeedback": "Great answer! Node.js has indeed had a big impact on the way we do server-side web development. Don't forget to mention how its NPM package manager has greatly streamlined the process of adding and managing dependencies in a project."

    "prompt": "How does the DOM help facilitate dynamic and interactive user interfaces in web development?",
    "response": "The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a representation of a web page as a tree-like structure, where each node represents an HTML element. It provides a way for JavaScript and other scripting languages to interact with the HTML elements of a web page. By enabling dynamic manipulation of the content and presentation of web pages, the DOM plays a crucial role in facilitating dynamic and interactive user interfaces in web development.",
    "resFeedback": "Very good answer! The DOM provides a way for web developers to interact with and manipulate the content of a web page, making it an essential component for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces."
